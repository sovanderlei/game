# Memory Game (Jogo de Mem√≥ria)

## Description

The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game built using React. The game board consists of a set of cards placed face down. The player clicks on two cards at a time to flip them over and attempts to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they are flipped back over to their original state.

## Features

- **Card Matching**: Players click on two cards to reveal them. If the cards are a match, they stay face up. If not, they return to being face down.
- **Array Storage**: The cards and their corresponding pairs are stored in an array for easy tracking and comparison.
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` are used to manage the game's state, including tracking flipped cards, checking for matches, and handling the game's timer and transitions.
- **Timers**: A timer tracks how long the player takes to complete the game. This can be used to add an element of challenge by showing the time taken.
- **Visual Effects**: Smooth transitions and animations are implemented for card flips and successful matches.

## Concepts Used

- **Arrays**: To store the card pairs and handle comparisons.
- **State Management**: Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the game's state.
- **Timers**: A countdown timer to keep track of the game duration.
- **CSS Transitions**: For smooth card flip animations and visual effects.
